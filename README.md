# nn_ploter
A Python script that provides a simple and efficient way to plot the architecture and parameters of neural network models using Matplotlib. With just a few lines of code, you can visualize the structure of your neural network and gain insights into its performance.

## Requirements
- Environment: Python3
- Lib: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

#### install matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run
```
demo.py
```

### From Python code
```
plot_NN(NN_Frame, input_text=None, output_text=None, save_fig=True)
```

The function takes arguments: layer_sizes and node_text, which are lists that specify the number of neurons in each layer of the network, and the text to be displayed within each node, respectively.
